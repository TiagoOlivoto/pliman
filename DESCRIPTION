Description: Provides tools for image manipulation that will help you to
    quantify plant leaf area, disease severity, number of disease lesions,
    and obtain statistics of image objects such as grains, pods, pollen,
    leaves, and more. Tools for segment images and create binary images
    using the method of automatic threshold selection method proposed by
    Otsu (1979) <doi:10.1109/tsmc.1979.4310076> are also provided.
