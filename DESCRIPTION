Description: Tools for single or batch image manipulation and analysis as
    described by Olivoto (2022) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13803> that can be
    used to quantify plant leaf area, assess disease severity, count
    objects, obtain shape measures, object landmarks, and compute
    Elliptical Fourier Analysis of the object outline, as described by
    Claude (2008) <doi:10.1007/978-0-387-77789-4>. Additionally, the
    package includes tools for analyzing RGB, multispectral, or hyperspectral 
    orthomosaics, which enables high throughput field phenotyping using UVAs- 
    or satelite-based imagery.
