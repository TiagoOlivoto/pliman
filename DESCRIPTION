Description: The pliman package provides a comprehensive set of tools for single
    or batch image manipulation. It offers functionalities to accurately quantify
    plant leaf area, assess disease severity, count objects, obtain shape measures, 
    object landmarks, and compute Fourier analysis of the object outline.
    Additionally, the package includes tools for analyzing grids, which enables
    high throughput field phenotyping using RGB imagery captured by unmanned
    aerial vehicles.
