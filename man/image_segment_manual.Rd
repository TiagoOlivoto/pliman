\title{Image segmentation by hand}
\usage{
image_segment_manual(
  image,
  shape = c("free", "circle", "rectangle"),
  type = c("select", "remove"),
  resize = TRUE,
  edge = 5,
  plot = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{image}{An \code{Image} object.}

\item{shape}{The type of shape to use. Defaults to "free". Other possible
values are "circle" and "rectangle". Partial matching is allowed.}

\item{type}{The type of segmentation. By default (\code{type = "select"}) objects
are selected. Use \code{type = "remove"} to remove the selected area from the
image.}

\item{resize}{By default, the segmented object is resized to fill the
original image size. Use \code{resize = FALSE} to keep the segmented object in
the original scale.}

\item{edge}{Number of pixels to add in the edge of the segmented object when
\code{resize = TRUE}. Defaults to 5.}

\item{plot}{Plot the segmented object? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list with the segmented image and the mask used for segmentation.
}
\description{
This R code is a function that allows the user to manually segment an image based on the parameters provided. This only works in an interactive section.
}
\details{
If the shape is "free", it allows the user to draw a perimeter to
select/remove objects. If the shape is "circle", it allows the user to
click on the center and edge of the circle to define the desired area. If
the shape is "rectangle", it allows the user to select two points to define
the area.
}
\examples{
if (interactive()) {
img <- image_pliman("la_leaves.jpg")
seg <- image_segment_manual(img)
plot(seg$mask)

}
}
