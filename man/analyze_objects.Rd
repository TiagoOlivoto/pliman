\arguments{
\item{img}{The image to be analyzed.}

\item{foreground}{A color palette of the foreground (optional).}

\item{background}{A color palette of the background (optional).}

\item{img_pattern}{A pattern of file name used to identify images to be
processed. For example, if \code{img_pattern = "im"} all images that the name
matches the pattern (e.g., img1.-, image1.-, im2.-) will be analyzed.
Providing any number as pattern (e.g., \code{img_pattern = "1"}) will select
images that are named as 1.-, 2.-, and so on.}

\item{parallel}{Processes the images asynchronously (in parallel) in separate
R sessions running in the background on the same machine. It may speed up
the processing time, especially when \code{img_pattern} is used is informed. The
number of sections is set up to 70\% of available cores.}

\item{workers}{A positive numeric scalar or a function specifying the number
of parallel processes that can be active at the same time.}

\item{resize}{Resize the image before processing? Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Use a
numeric value of range 0-100 (proportion of the size of the original
image).}

\item{trim}{Number of pixels removed from edges in the analysis. The edges of
images are often shaded, which can affect image analysis. The edges of
images can be removed by specifying the number of pixels. Defaults to
\code{FALSE} (no trimmed edges).}

\item{fill_hull}{Fill holes in the binary image? Defaults to \code{FALSE}. This is
useful to fill holes in objects that have portions with a color similar to
the background. IMPORTANT: Objects touching each other can be combined into
one single object, which may underestimate the number of objects in an
image.}

\item{filter}{Performs median filtering after image processing? defaults to
\code{FALSE}. See more at \code{\link[=image_filter]{image_filter()}}.}

\item{invert}{Inverts the binary image, if desired. This is useful to process
images with black background. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{index, my_index}{A character value specifying the target mode for
conversion to binary image when \code{foreground} and \code{background} are not
declared. Defaults to \code{"NB"} (normalized blue). See \code{\link[=image_index]{image_index()}} for
more details.}

\item{object_size}{The size of the object. Used to automatically set up
\code{tolerance} and \code{extension} parameters. One of the following. \code{"small"}
(e.g, wheat grains), \code{"medium"} (e.g, soybean grains), \code{"large"}(e.g,
peanut grains), and \code{"elarge"} (e.g, soybean pods)`.}

\item{tolerance}{The minimum height of the object in the units of image
intensity between its highest point (seed) and the point where it contacts
another object (checked for every contact pixel). If the height is smaller
than the tolerance, the object will be combined with one of its neighbors,
which is the highest.}

\item{extension}{Radius of the neighborhood in pixels for the detection of
neighboring objects. Defaults to 20. Higher value smooths out small
objects.}

\item{lower_size, upper_size}{Lower and upper limits for size for the image
analysis. Plant images often contain dirt and dust. To prevent dust from
affecting the image analysis, objects with lesser than 10\% of the mean of
all objects are removed. Upper limit is set to \code{NULL}, i.e., no upper
limit used. One can set a known area or use \code{lower_limit = 0} to select all
objects (not advised). Objects that matches the size of a given range of
sizes can be selected by setting up the two arguments. For example, if
\code{lower_size = 120} and \code{upper_size = 140}, objects with size greater than
or equal 120 and less than or equal 140 will be considered.}

\item{topn_lower, topn_upper}{Select the top \code{n} objects based on its area.
\code{topn_lower} selects the \code{n} elements with the smallest area whereas
\code{topn_upper} selects the \code{n} objects with the largest area.}

\item{randomize}{Randomize the lines before training the model?}

\item{nrows}{The number of lines to be used in training step. Defaults to
2000.}

\item{show_image}{Show image after processing?}

\item{show_original}{Show the count objects in the original image?}

\item{show_background}{Show the background? Defaults to \code{TRUE}. A white
background is shown by default when \code{show_original = FALSE}.}

\item{show_segmentation}{Shows the object segmentation colored with random
permutations. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{col_foreground, col_background}{Foreground and background color after
image processing. Defaults to \code{NULL}, in which \code{"black"}, and \code{"white"} are
used, respectively.}

\item{marker, marker_col, marker_size}{The type, color and size of the object
marker. Defaults to \code{NULL}, which shows a red point when \code{show_segmentation = FALSE}. To force a marker to be used with segmented objects, set up to
\code{marker = "point"} (to show a point) or \code{marker = "text"} to enumerate the
objects.}

\item{save_image}{Save the image after processing? The image is saved in the
current working directory named as \verb{proc_*} where \code{*} is the image name
given in \code{img}.}

\item{prefix}{The prefix to be included in the processed images. Defaults to
\code{"proc_"}.}

\item{dir_original, dir_processed}{The directory containing the original and
processed images. Defaults to \code{NULL}. In this case, the function will
search for the image \code{img} in the current working directory. After
processing, when \code{save_image = TRUE}, the processed image will be also
saved in such a directory.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE} (default) a summary is shown in the console.}
}
\value{
A list with the following objects:
\itemize{
\item \code{results} A data frame with the results (area, perimeter, radius) for
object.
\item \code{statistics} A data frame with the summary statistics for the image.
\item \code{count} (If \code{img_pattern} is used), summarizing the count number for each
image.
}

\description{
Counts the number of objects in an image. See more at details.

\details{
Counts the number of objects in an image. A binary image is first generated to
segment the foreground and background. The argument index is useful to choose
a proper index to segment the image (see \code{\link[=image_binary]{image_binary()}} for more details).
Then, the number of objects in the foreground is counted. By setting up
arguments such as \code{lower_size}, \code{upper_size} is possible to set a threshold
for lower and upper sizes of the objects, respectively.  Change \code{tolerance}
and \code{extension} values to better set up watershed-based object detection. If
color palettes samples are provided, a general linear model (binomial family)
fitted to the RGB values is used to segment fore- and background.

By using \code{img_pattern} it is possible to process several images with common
pattern names that are stored in the current working directory or in the
subdirectory informed in \code{dir_original}'. To speed up the computation time,
one can set \code{parallel = TRUE}.
