\usage{
get_measures(
  object,
  dpi = NULL,
  id = NULL,
  measure = NULL,
  true_value = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)

plot_measures(
  object,
  measure = "id",
  digits = 2,
  size = 0.9,
  col = "white",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object computed with \code{\link[=count_objects]{count_objects()}} or \code{\link[=leaf_area]{leaf_area()}}.}

\item{dpi}{A known resolution of the image in DPI (dots per inch).}

\item{id}{An object in the image to indicate a known value.}

\item{measure}{The measure of the known object. One of the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{"area"} The known area of the object.
\item \code{"perimeter"} The known perimeter of the object.
\item \code{"radius_mean"} The known radius of the object.
\item \code{"radius_min"} The known minimum radius of the object. If the object is a
square, then the \code{radius_min} of such object will be \code{L/2} where \code{L} is the
length of the square side.
\item \code{"radius_max"} The known maximum radius of the object. If the object is a
square, then the \code{radius_max} of such object according to the Pythagorean
theorem will be \verb{L x sqrt(2) / 2} where \code{L} is the length of the square side.
}}

\item{true_value}{The know value of the object \code{id.}}

\item{verbose}{If \code{FALSE}, runs the code silently.}

\item{digits}{The number of significant figures. Defaults to \code{2.}}

\item{size}{The size of the text. Defaults to \code{0.9}.}

\item{col}{The color of the text. Defaults to \code{"white"}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed on to \code{\link[graphics:text]{graphics::text()}}.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{get_measures()} returns a data frame with the object \code{id} and the measures. If any of the
\code{"area"}, \code{"perimeter"}, \code{"radius_mean"}, \code{"radius_min"} or \code{"radius_max"}
is informed, the informed measure will be returned in the unit given in
\code{true_value} and the other measures in pixels. If \code{dpi} is informed, then
all the measures will be adjusted to the known \code{dpi} and the values
returned in cm2 (area) and cm (the other measures).
\item \code{plot_measures()} returns a \code{NULL} object, drawing the text according to
the x and y coordinates of the objects in \code{object}.
}
}
\description{
\itemize{
\item \code{get_measures()} Computes object measures (area, perimeter, radius) by using
either a known resolution (dpi) or an object with known measurements.
\item \code{plot_measures()} draws the object measures given in an object to the
current plot. The object identification (\code{"id"}) is drawn by default.
