\arguments{
\item{img}{The image to be analyzed.}

\item{index}{A character value specifying the target mode for
conversion to binary to segment the leaves from background. Defaults to "B"
(blue). See \code{\link[=image_index]{image_index()}} for more details. Personalized indexes can be
informed as, e.g., \verb{index = "R*G/B}.}

\item{lower_size}{To prevent dust from affecting object segmentation, objects
with lesser than \verb{10\%} of the mean of all objects are removed. . One can
set a known area or use \code{lower_limit = 0} to select all objects (not
advised).}

\item{watershed}{If \code{TRUE} (default) performs watershed-based object
detection. This will detect objects even when they are touching one other.
If \code{FALSE}, all pixels for each connected set of foreground pixels are set
to a unique object. This is faster but is not able to segment touching
objects.}

\item{invert}{Inverts the binary image if desired. This is useful to process
images with a black background. Defaults to \code{FALSE}. If \code{reference = TRUE}
is use, \code{invert} can be declared as a logical vector of length 2 (eg.,
\verb{invert = c(FALSE, TRUE}). In this case, the segmentation of objects and
reference from the foreground using \code{back_fore_index} is performed using
the default (not inverted), and the segmentation of objects from the
reference is performed by inverting the selection (selecting pixels higher
than the threshold).}

\item{fill_hull}{Fill holes in the binary image? Defaults to \code{FALSE}. This is
useful to fill holes in objects that have portions with a color similar to
the background. IMPORTANT: Objects touching each other can be combined into
one single object, which may underestimate the number of objects in an
image.}

\item{filter}{Performs median filtering in the binary image? See more at
\code{\link[=image_filter]{image_filter()}}. Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Use a positive integer to define the
size of the median filtering. Larger values are effective at removing
noise, but adversely affect edges.}

\item{threshold}{By default (\code{threshold = "Otsu"}), a threshold value based
on Otsu's method is used to reduce the grayscale image to a binary image.
If a numeric value is informed, this value will be used as a threshold.
Inform any non-numeric value different than "Otsu" to iteratively chosen
the threshold based on a raster plot showing pixel intensity of the index.}

\item{extension}{Radius of the neighborhood in pixels for the detection of
neighboring objects. Higher value smooths out small objects.}

\item{tolerance}{The minimum height of the object in the units of image
intensity between its highest point (seed) and the point where it contacts
another object (checked for every contact pixel). If the height is smaller
than the tolerance, the object will be combined with one of its neighbors,
which is the highest.}

\item{object_size}{The size of the object. Used to automatically set up
\code{tolerance} and \code{extension} parameters. One of the following. \code{"small"}
(e.g, wheat grains), \code{"medium"} (e.g, soybean grains), \code{"large"}(e.g,
peanut grains), and \code{"elarge"} (e.g, soybean pods)`.}

\item{keep_location}{A logical argument (defaults to \code{TRUE}). If \code{FALSE}, the
new image is created with the object in the exactly position of the
original image.}

\item{dir_original}{The directory containing the original and processed images.
Defaults to \code{NULL}. In this case, the function will search for the image \code{img} in the
current working directory.}

\item{img_healthy}{A color palette of healthy tissues.}

\item{img_symptoms}{A color palette of lesioned tissues.}

\item{pattern}{A pattern of file name used to identify images to be
processed. For example, if \code{pattern = "im"} all images that the name
matches the pattern (e.g., img1.-, image1.-, im2.-) will be analyzed.
Providing any number as pattern (e.g., \code{pattern = "1"}) will select
images that are named as 1.-, 2.-, and so on.}

\item{parallel}{Processes the images asynchronously (in parallel) in separate
R sessions running in the background on the same machine. It may speed up
the processing time, especially when \code{pattern} is used is informed. The
number of sections is set up to 70\% of available cores.}

\item{workers}{A positive numeric scalar or a function specifying the maximum
number of parallel processes that can be active at the same time.}

\item{show_image}{Show image after processing?}

\item{show_features}{If \code{TRUE} returnS the lesion features such as number,
area, perimeter, and radius. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{save_image}{Save the image after processing? The image is saved in the
current working directory named as \verb{proc_*} where \code{*} is the image name
given in \code{img}.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE} (default) a summary is shown in the console.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to \code{\link[=measure_disease]{measure_disease()}}.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item A list with the following objects:
\itemize{
\item \code{severity} A data frame with the percentage of healthy and symptomatic
areas for each leaf in the image(s).
\item \code{shape},\code{statistics} If \code{show_features = TRUE} is used, returns the shape
(area, perimeter, etc.) for each lesion and a summary statistic of the
results.
}
}
}
\description{
Computes the percentage of symptomatic leaf area using color palettes or RGB
indexes \code{by} each \code{l}eaf of an image. This allows, for example, processing
replicates of the same treatment  and obtaining the results for each
replication with a single image. To do that, leaf samples are first splitten
with \code{\link[=object_split]{object_split()}} and then, \code{\link[=measure_disease]{measure_disease()}} is applied to the list of
leaves. Arguments \code{img} to \code{keep_location} are passed on to \code{\link[=object_split]{object_split()}}.
Arguments \code{dir_original} to \code{...} are passed on to \code{\link[=measure_disease]{measure_disease()}}.
