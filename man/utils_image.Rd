image_import(
  image,
  ...,
  which = 1,
  pattern = NULL,
  path = NULL,
  plot = FALSE,
  nrow = NULL,
  ncol = NULL
)

}
\arguments{
\item{image}{\itemize{
\item For \code{image_import()}, a character vector of file names or URLs.
\item For \code{image_export()}, an Image object, an array or a list of images.
\item For \code{image_pliman()}, a charactere value specifying the image example. See
\code{?pliman_images} for more details.
}}

\item{...}{Alternative arguments passed to the corresponding functions from
the \code{jpeg}, \code{png}, and \code{tiff} packages.}

\item{which}{logical scalar or integer vector to indicate which image are
imported if a TIFF files is informed. Defaults to \code{1} (the first image is
returned).}

\item{pattern}{A pattern of file name used to identify images to be imported.
For example, if \code{pattern = "im"} all images in the current working
directory that the name matches the pattern (e.g., img1.-, image1.-, im2.-)
will be imported as a list. Providing any number as pattern (e.g., \code{pattern = "1"}) will select images that are named as 1.-, 2.-, and so on. An error
will be returned if the pattern matches any file that is not supported
(e.g., img1.pdf).}

\item{path}{A character vector of full path names; the default corresponds to
the working directory, \code{\link[=getwd]{getwd()}}. It will overwrite (if given) the path
informed in \code{image} argument.}

\item{plot}{Plots the image after importing? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{nrow, ncol}{Passed on to \code{\link[=image_combine]{image_combine()}}. The number of rows and
columns to use in the composite image when \code{plot = TRUE}.}

\item{name}{An string specifying the name of the image. It can be either a
character with the image name (e.g., "img1") or name and extension (e.g.,
"img1.jpg"). If none file extension is provided, the image will be saved as
a *.jpg file.}

\item{prefix}{A prefix to include in the image name when exporting a list of
images. Defaults to \code{""}, i.e., no prefix.}

\item{extension}{When \code{image} is a list, \code{extension} can be used to define
the extension of exported files. This will overwrite the file extensions
given in \code{image}.}

\item{subfolder}{Optional character string indicating a subfolder within the
current working directory to save the image(s). If the folder doesn't
exist, it will be created.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{image_import()} returns a new \code{Image} object.
\item \code{image_export()} returns an invisible vector of file names.
\item \code{image_pliman()} returns a new \code{Image} object with the example image
required. If an empty call is used, the path to the \code{tmp_images} directory
installed with the package is returned.
