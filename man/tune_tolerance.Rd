  start_tol = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{img}{The image to be analyzed.}

\item{actual}{The actual number of objects.}

\item{start_tol}{An starting value for tolerance.}

\item{extension}{The extension value. Defaults to 1.}

\item{grid}{A list with a numeric sequence for'tolerance' and 'extension'
values. When grid is informed, all combinations are tested and the residual
from \code{actual} value is plotted.}

\item{maxiter}{The maximum number of iterations. Default to 200.}

\item{index, my_index}{A character value specifying the target mode for
conversion to binary image when \code{foreground} and \code{background} are not
declared. Defaults to \code{"NB"} (normalized blue). See \code{\link[=image_index]{image_index()}} for
more details.}

\item{plot}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default) generates a plot showing the
results.}

\item{fill_hull}{Fill holes in the binary image? Defaults to \code{FALSE}. This is
useful to fill holes in objects that have portions with a color similar to
the background. IMPORTANT: Objects touching each other can be combined into
one single object, which may underestimate the number of objects in an
image.}

\item{filter}{Performs median filtering after image processing? defaults to
\code{FALSE}. See more at \code{\link[=image_filter]{image_filter()}}.}

\item{invert}{Inverts the binary image, if desired. This is useful to process
images with black background. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{workers}{The number of multiple sections to be used in the computation.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE} (default) a summary is shown in the console.}
}
\description{
Provides tools for counting and extracting objects' features (e.g., area,
perimeter, radius) in an image. See more at \strong{Details} section.
}
\details{
A binary image is first generated to segment the foreground and background.
The argument index is useful to choose a proper index to segment the image.
