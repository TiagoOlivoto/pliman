\usage{
measure_disease_shp(
  img,
  nrow = 1,
  ncol = 1,
  index_lb = "HUE2",
  index_dh = "NGRDI",
  pattern = NULL,
  threshold = NULL,
  invert = FALSE,
  dir_original = NULL,
  show_features = FALSE,
  interactive = FALSE,
  plot = TRUE,
  parallel = FALSE,
  workers = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{The image to be analyzed. Either an image of class \code{Image} or a
character string containing the image name. In the last, the image will be
searched in the root directory. Declare dir_original to inform a subfolder
that contains the images to be processed.}

\item{nrow, ncol}{The number of rows and columns to generate the shapefile.
Defaults to \code{1}.}

\item{index_lb}{The index used to segment the foreground (e.g., leaf) from
the background. If not declared, the entire image area (pixels) will be
considered in the computation of the severity.}

\item{index_dh}{The index used to segment diseased from healthy tissues when
\code{img_healthy} and \code{img_symptoms} are not declared. Defaults to \code{"GLI"}. See
\code{\link[=image_index]{image_index()}} for more details.}

\item{pattern}{A pattern of file name used to identify images to be
processed. For example, if \code{pattern = "im"} all images that the name
matches the pattern (e.g., img1.-, image1.-, im2.-) will be analyzed.
Providing any number as pattern (e.g., \code{pattern = "1"}) will select
images that are named as 1.-, 2.-, and so on.}

\item{threshold}{By default (\code{threshold = NULL}), a threshold value based on
Otsu's method is used to reduce the grayscale image to a binary image. If a
numeric value is informed, this value will be used as a threshold. Inform
any non-numeric value different than "Otsu" to iteratively choose the
threshold based on a raster plot showing pixel intensity of the index. Must
be a vector of length 2 to indicate the threshold for \code{index_lb} and
\code{index_dh}, respectively.}

\item{invert}{Inverts the binary image if desired. This is useful to process
images with black background. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{dir_original}{The directory containing the original and processed images.
Defaults to \code{NULL}. In this case, the function will search for the image \code{img} in the
current working directory.}

\item{show_features}{If \code{TRUE} returnS the lesion features such as number,
area, perimeter, and radius. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{interactive}{If \code{FALSE} (default) the grid is created automatically
based on the image dimension and number of rows/columns. If \code{interactive = TRUE}, users must draw points at the diagonal of the desired bounding box
that will contain the grid.}

\item{plot}{Show image after processing? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{parallel}{Processes the images asynchronously (in parallel) in separate
R sessions running in the background on the same machine. It may speed up
the processing time, especially when \code{pattern} is used is informed. The
number of sections is set up to 70\% of available cores.}

\item{workers}{A positive numeric scalar or a function specifying the maximum
number of parallel processes that can be active at the same time.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE} (default) a summary is shown in the console.}

\item{...}{Aditional arguments passed on to \link{measure_disease}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{plm_disease_byl}. See more details in the \code{Value}
section of \code{\link[=measure_disease]{measure_disease()}}.
}
\description{
This function calls \code{\link[=measure_disease]{measure_disease()}} in each image polygon of a shapefile
object generated with \code{\link[=image_shp]{image_shp()}} and bind the results into read-ready data
frames.
