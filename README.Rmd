The pliman (**pl**ant **im**age **an**alysis) package is designed to analyze plant images, particularly for leaf and seed analysis. It offers a range of functionalities to assist with various tasks such as measuring disease severity, counting lesions, obtaining lesion shapes, counting objects in an image, extracting object characteristics, performing Fourier Analysis, obtaining RGB values, extracting object coordinates and outlines, isolating objects, and plotting object measurements.

`pliman` also provides useful functions for image transformation, binarization, segmentation, and resolution. Please visit the [Examples](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/pliman/reference/index.html) page on the `pliman` website for detailed documentation of each function.

# Installation

Install the latest stable version of `pliman` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pliman) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("pliman")

```

The development version of `pliman` can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/TiagoOlivoto/pliman) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("TiagoOlivoto/pliman")

# To build the HTML vignette use
devtools::install_github("TiagoOlivoto/pliman", build_vignettes = TRUE)

```

*Note*: If you are a Windows user, you should also first download and install the latest version of [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

# Analyze objects

The function `analyze_objects()` can be used to analyze objects such as leaves, grains, pods, and pollen in an image. By default, all measures are returned in pixel units. Users can [adjust the object measures](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/pliman/articles/analyze_objects.html#adjusting-object-measures) with `get_measures()` provided that the image resolution (Dots Per Inch) is known. Another option is to use a reference object in the image. In this last case, the argument `reference` must be set to `TRUE`. There are two options to identify the reference object:

1.  By its color, using the arguments `back_fore_index` and `fore_ref_index`\
2.  By its size, using the arguments `reference_larger` or `reference_smaller`

In both cases, the `reference_area` must be declared. Let's see how to analyze an image with flax grains containing a reference object (rectangle with 2x3 cm). Here, we'll identify the reference object by its size; so, the final results in this case will be in metric units (cm).

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(pliman)
img <- image_pliman("flax_grains.jpg")
flax <- 
  analyze_objects(img,
                  index = "GRAY",
                  reference = TRUE,
                  reference_larger = TRUE,
                  reference_area = 6,
                  marker = "point",
                  marker_size = 0.5,
                  marker_col = "red", # default is white
                  show_contour = FALSE) # default is TRUE
# summary statistics
flax$statistics

# plot the density of the grain's length (in cm)
plot(flax, measure = "length")
```

# Analyzing shapefiles

The `analyze_objects_shp()` function performs object analysis based on shapefiles (rows and columns). Possible applications include computing canopy coverage and vegetation indexes useful for high-throughput phenotyping. By default `analyze_objects_shp()` calls `image_prepare_mv()` internally, allowing alignment and crop the image before processing. In the following example, we compute the canopy coverage and the Normalized Green Red Difference Index (NGRDI) for each one of the 12 soybean plots.

```{r}
shp <- image_pliman("field_mosaic.jpg")
res <- 
  analyze_objects_shp(shp, 
                      ncol = 12,
                      nrow = 1,
                      buffer_x = 0.1, # defaults is 0
                      index = "HUE", # used to segment the soil
                      object_index = "NGRDI") 
plot_index_shp(res, attribute = "coverage", viewer = "base")
```

# Analyzing orthomosaics

## Canopy coverage and multispectral indexes
In this example, a multispectral orthomosaic originally available [here](https://github.com/diegojgris/draw-plots-qgis/blob/main/sampledata/MicaSenseMXRed_5bands.tif) is used to show how `mosaic_analyze()` can be used to compute the plot coverage and statistics such as min, mean, and max values of three multispectral indexes (NDVI, EVI, and NDRE) using a design that includes 6 rows and 15 plots per row. Note how two plots were removed during the live editing step.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(pliman)
url <- "https://github.com/TiagoOlivoto/images/raw/master/pliman/NDSU/ndsu.tif"
mosaic <- mosaic_input(url)

url_shp <- "https://github.com/TiagoOlivoto/images/raw/master/pliman/NDSU/ndsu_shp.shp"
shapefile <- shapefile_input(url_shp)

res <- 
  mosaic_analyze(mosaic,
                 shapefile = shapefile,
                 # the following arguments can be ignored when a shapefile is provided
                 # nrow = 3,  # use 6 if you want to analyze in a single block
                 # ncol = 15,
                 # buffer_row = -0.15,
                 # buffer_col = -0.05,
                 segment_plot = TRUE,
                 segment_index = "NDVI", 
                 plot_index = c("NDVI", "EVI", "NDRE"), 
                 summarize_fun = c("min", "mean", "max"),
                 attribute = "coverage")
res$map_plot


```

# Disease severity

## Using image indexes

To compute the percentage of symptomatic leaf area you can use the `measure_disease()` function you can use an image index to segment the entire leaf from the background and then separate the diseased tissue from the healthy tissue. Alternatively, you can provide color palette samples to the `measure_disease()` function. In this approach, the function fits a general linear model (binomial family) to the RGB values of the image. It then uses the color palette samples to segment the lesions from the healthy leaf.

In the following example, we compute the symptomatic area of a soybean leaf. The proportion of healthy and symptomatic areas is given as a proportion of the total leaf area after segmenting the leaf from the background (blue).

```{r}
img <- image_pliman("sev_leaf.jpg")
# Computes the symptomatic area
sev <- 
measure_disease(img = img,
                index_lb = "B", # to remove the background
                index_dh = "NGRDI", # to isolate the diseased area
                threshold = c("Otsu", 0), # You can also use the Otsu algorithm in both indexes (default)
                plot = TRUE)
sev$severity
```

## Interactive disease measurements

An alternative approach to measuring disease percentage is available through the `measure_disease_iter()` function. This function offers an interactive interface that empowers users to manually select sample colors directly from the image. By doing so, it provides a highly customizable analysis method.

One advantage of using `measure_disease_iter()` is the ability to utilize the "mapview" viewer, which enhances the analysis process by offering zoom-in options. This feature allows users to closely examine specific areas of the image, enabling detailed inspection and accurate disease measurement.

```{r eval=FALSE}
img <- image_pliman("sev_leaf.jpg", plot = TRUE)

# works only in an interactive section
measure_disease_iter(img, viewer = "mapview")
```
