# Getting started
`pliman` (**pl**ant **im**age **an**anlysis) is designed to analyze plant images, especially related to leaf analysis. You provide color palettes, tell `pliman` what each one represents, and it takes care of the details. The package will help you to:

* Measure leaf area with `leaf_area()`.
* Measure disease severity with `symptomatic_area()`.
* Count the number of lesions with `count_lesions()`.
* Count objects in an image with `count_objects()`.
* Get the RGB values for each object in an image with `objects_rgb()`.
* Get object measures with `get_measures()`.
* Plot objec measures with `plot_measures()`.


# Leaf area
The function `leaf_area()` can be used to computes the leaf area using an image with leaves and a template with a known area. A general linear model (binomial family) fitted to the RGB values is used to first separate the leaves and template from the background and then the leaves from the template. The leaf area is then calculated for each leaf based on the pixel area.

In the following example, the area of five three leaves will be computed using a reference template with a known area of 4 cm$^2$.

```{r}
library(pliman)
img <- image_import(image_pliman("la_pattern.JPG"))
leaf <- image_import(image_pliman("la_leaf.jpg"))
tmpl <- image_import(image_pliman("la_temp.jpg"))
background <- image_import(image_pliman("la_back.jpg"))
image_combine(img, leaf, tmpl, background)


# Computes the leaf area
area <- 
leaf_area(img = img,
          img_leaf = leaf,
          img_template = tmpl,
          img_background = background,
          area_template = 4,
          text_col = "white")
get_measures(area)
```


# Counting crop grains 

Here, we will count the grains in the image `soybean_touch.png`. This image has a cyan background and contains 30 soybean grains that touch with each other.

```{r}
soy <- image_import(image_pliman("soybean_touch.jpg"))
image_show(soy)

# Count the objects in the image
grains <- count_objects(soy)

# Draws the object id (by default)
plot_measures(grains)
```



# Disease severity
The function `symptomatic_area()` is used to compute the percentage of symptomatic leaf area in a sample or entire leaf based on provided color palettes samples. A general linear model (binomial family) fitted to the RGB values is used to segment the lesions from the healthy leaf. If a pallet of background is provided, the function takes care of the details to isolate it before computing the number and area of lesions.

The next example computes the symptomatic area of a soybean leaf. The proportion of the healthy and symptomatic areas is given as the proportion of the total leaf area, after segmenting the leaf from the background (blue).

```{r}
img <- image_import(image_pliman("sev_leaf.jpg"))
healthy <- image_import(image_pliman("sev_healthy.jpg"))
symptoms <- image_import(image_pliman("sev_sympt.jpg"))
background <- image_import(image_pliman("sev_back.jpg"))
image_combine(img, healthy, symptoms,background)

# Computes the symptomatic area
symptomatic_area(img = img,
                 img_healthy = healthy,
                 img_symptoms = symptoms,
                 img_background = background,
                 show_image = TRUE)
```


# RGB values for objects
The function `objects_rgb()` can be used to get the Red Green and Blue (RGB) for objects in an image. Here, the RGB for 

```{r}
img <- image_import(image_pliman("soy_green.jpg"))
# Segment the foreground (grains) using the normalized blue index
# Shows the average value of the blue index in each object
rgb <- objects_rgb(img, marker = "index")

# Draw the object id
image_show(img)
plot_measures(rgb)

# plot the distribution of RGB values of each object
plot(rgb)
```
